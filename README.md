<h2 align="center">Hey!</h2>

Hi! I am a Backend Software Engineer with 11+ years of experience based in SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil, currently working as a **Senior Backend Software Engineer @[Mercado Pago / Mercado Livre](https://careers-meli.mercadolibre.com/pt)** (we're hiring!).

Nowadays my mainly stack is Golang, but as a good Software Enginner that isn't a rule, I can learn fast and use other stacks.

Stacks that I used:
  - Golang
  - Java
  - NodeJS / TypeScript
  - C#
  - Delphi
  - VB

I don't have so much commits right here because the most part os repos are privates, but I'm proud to work as a backend ðŸ˜„

My passion is create an environment that could helps more people improve their lives.
